### Hi there, I'm fakhrads (Fakhri Adi Saputra) ðŸ‘‹
A devoted Potterhead and Greek mythology enthusiast who spends his days weaving magic in the world of programming. My primary wand, the mighty JavaScript/TypeScript, has been the cornerstone of his spellcasting for years. Recently, I decided to embark on a quest into the enchanted realm of Golang, curious about the whispers of magic in the air surrounding Microservices.
